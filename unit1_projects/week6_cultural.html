				<h2> The Stereotype Threat</h2>
					<p> I actually touched on this subject in a previous blog post when I wrote about an issue that the tech industry faces which is a lack of women. As a female engineering student at a career fair, I often heard from people (even friends) that "Girls have no problem getting a job because they are girls. Everyone hires girls." I think they meant this in an encouraging way. I think what they meant to say is "Don't worry about getting the job. You have a lot of great qualities that recruiters target."</p>
					<p> However, specifically mentioning gender in relation to getting an interview or a job diminishes the accomplishment. If I choose to believe that employers are actively seeking women to the point where gender overrides a lot my resume, then it begins to become hard to feel as if I have earned anything.</p>
					<p> And I think these stereotype threats are part of what is called 'The Pipeline Problem.' Over and over, you hear that there aren't enough minorties in tech. Here is a great example: At Google and Yahoo, an overwhelming majority of their workforce are male. They are only the only two large tech companies to reveal <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/06/17/323040120/how-yahoos-diversity-numbers-compare-to-googles?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20140617"> their diversity statistics</a>.</p>
