				<h2> OOP vs Functional</h2>
					<h4> OOP</h4>
					<p> Object Oriented Programming is organized around objects and data rather than 'actions' and logic.</p>
					<p> Advantages</p>
					<li> Reuse of Classes: Classes definitions are reusable by the progam it is originally written for as well as other object oriented programs. They can be reused!</li>
					<li> New data types: Programmers can make new data types. These data types can be used to define data more clearly </li>
					<li> inheritance: A class can have subclasses. This makes organization of data and information easier. It reduces development time</li>

			<h2> The Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<p> I actually touched on this subject in a previous blog post when I wrote about an issue that the tech industry faces which is a lack of women. As a female engineering student at a career fair, I often heard from people (even friends) that "Girls have no problem getting a job because they are girls. Everyone hires girls."
