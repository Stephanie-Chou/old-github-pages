					<h2> Conflict</h2>
					<ol>
						<li> <h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? </h4></li> 
						<p> I had to google emotional conflict to find out what experience I have had that might qualify. An emotional conflict is </p>
						<p class="quote"> "the presence of different and opposing emotions relating to a situation that has recently taken place or is in the process of being unfolded".</p> 
						<p>  Without getting too personal...? I don't like conflict and I tend to avoid conflict with people.</p>
						<p> I had a summer internship where I was leading a project. I had less experience than most of the team technically but I had more confidence to lead, so I was appointed 'team leader'. One member of the team felt he was being helpful and inqusitive. I felt he was continually off task and distant from the team. I also had a sense that he paid me unnecessary attention which made me slightly uncomfortable.</p>
						 <li> <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4></li> 
						 <p> Lack of communication or poor communication tends to be the source of most conflicts and frustrations. In this situation, I wanted to distance myself as much as possible from this guy because of the unwanted attention but if you distance yourself from a team member, that only makes the communication worse. That also worsens his contribution to the team since.</p>
						 <li> <h4>How did you handle that conflict? </h4></li>
						 <p> <a href="http://www.mediate.com/articles/albright.cfm"> How to mediate your emotional conflicts in the workplace.</a></p> <p> I tried to ignore his attentions and delegate him simple, straightforward but very needed tasks. He worked well with a to do list to accomplish. I had to be careful not to let my frustration and annoyance show when speaking to him.</p>
						 <li> <h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4></li> 
						 <p> He got his work done, so that was good. Because I knew this was a summer internship and I wouldn't have to work with him again after a few weeks, it was easier to deal with the situation in the way that I did.</p>
						 <li> <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4></li> 
						 <p> Had this been a longer term project and if I were to work with him again, (which I actually did eventually do) I would talk to him if I felt his attention was really getting in the way of my ability to work with him. I would ask him to reflect on his work so far and ask him where I or the rest of the team could help him. I would also let him know my side and tell him 'I am getting this vibe from you, it's uncomfortable whether intentional or not".</p>
						 <li> <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4></li> 
						 <p> I learned how to work with a team member who is not really  acting as part of the team. I also learned that I don't respond very well if one person really frustrates me. Since I am aware of this, I have learned to control the feeling and recognize my own frustration when it happens. This helped a lot when I had to work with this person again. </p>
