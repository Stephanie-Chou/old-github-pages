				<h2> How to undo a Horrible Commit</h2>
				<p> I have heard these 4 heartbreaking words, this death blow of a phrase twice <div class="quote"> Who pushed to Master?</div> It is something we all fear doing at DBC because it means we over wrote the original source code for the day's challenge and now everyone sees your code instead of the instructor's. So either they now have the answer- or some horribly convoluted spaghetti pile. No one appreciates it. Nate (our instructor) showed me how to undo this travesty.</p>
				<p> But it seems, I am prone to truely awful Github mistakes...</p>
				<p> Tonight, I did something even worse than pushing to the DBC master. I had extra files floating around in my repository so I thought I'd delete them in one fell swoop. I typed 'git rm . -r'. Apparently, that literally deletes all the files in your repository. All of them. Needless to say, I panicked the hell out. Wouldn't you?</p>
				<p> Luckily, because of past mistakes, this egregious error could be immediately rectified. Here is how you do it: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>In command line type: <div class="console">git log</div></li>
					<li> In that log, you'll see a list with commit names and commit ids. Those are the long numbers. Copy/paste the commit id of the last commit where your code was still good. </li>
					<li> Now, get out of the long list by hitting enter a lot. I don't know how else to do it.</li>
					<li> In command line type: <div class="console">git reset --hard commit_id</div></li>
					<li> In command line type: <div class="console">git push -f origin </div></li>

				</ol>
