				<h2> Learning Style</h2>
				
				<p>My thinking style was identified as concrete sequential. According to this I like:</p>
				<li>following directions</li>
				<li>order</li>
				<li>getting facts</li>

				<p> I always find that I like mentorship and someone to ask questions and get clarification. I definitely think in terms of setting parameters or deliverables. I think part of this is a product of my personality an a lot of these tendencies are a product of my education as an engineer. In engineering, there is a lot of facts and directions. In projects, there are specifications which need to be followed.</p>



				<p>Apparently I have difficulty with:</p>
				<li> working in groups</li>
				<li> lack of clarity, direction or unpredictability</li>
				<li> ambiguity</li>

				<p> I don't usually find that I have problems working in groups. However, I do get frustrated in group situations where the group has no organization. For example, I think it is easier to work in groups where each member has specific, actionable tasks. I also work best with semi-set timelines and goals. I know others work better with more flexibility.</p> 
				<p>I think a lot of this is reflective of difficulty working with unpredictability and lack of direction.</p>


				<p>learning preferences</p>
				<li> structure!</li>
				<p> I do like structured environments for learning. This is part of the reason I started to look into dev bootcamps- I felt they would provide more structure for me to learn. When I tell peers that I am going to a Dev Bootcamp for Web development, a few with CS backgrounds just tell me "isn't thata something you can learn on your own." I find that a frustrating, and even somewhat arrogant comment. Apparently they haven't learned about different learning styles! I think what Dev Bootcamp provides that really helps is a community to help, goals and projects. It's hard for me to create my own projects and goals. I think this may be reflective of difficulty when asked to 'use my imagination.'</p>
