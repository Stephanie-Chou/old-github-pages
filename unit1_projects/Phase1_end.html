				<h2> A few things I didn't know about DBC, and now that I do, they seem worthy of sharing</h2>

				<h3> The Daily Schedule</h3>
				<li> 8:00 am- you are here before then. this is when the first announcements of the day are made. </li>
				<li> 9:00 -11:30 am- some mix of work time, lecture and/or activity (see below!)</li>
				<li> 11:30 am- Lunch! some people work, others work out. It's up to you.</li>
				<li> 1:00 pm - be back from lunch for afternoon announcements! At Chicago, we tell a joke. </li>
				<li> 1:00 - 5:00 pm- some mix of work time, lecture and/or activity. Working 'officially' ends at 5:00pm</li>
				<li> after 5 pm- people leave anywhere between 5 and 9 pm (on average). Since you have a set of daily challenges, you might want to stick around and finish those. It's really beneficial to just go for it and finish everything. The people here are awesome and you'll want to have them on hand to ask questions.</li>
				
				<h3> The Weekly stuff/ 'perks'</h3>
				<li> Yoga- lessons twice a week for an hour led by professional yoga instructors. The sessions really focus the areas that get tight when you sit and code for 12 hours.</li>
				<li> DBCx- you might have heard of these but every thursday at 530 there is a speaker. That person is from the tech community and shares whatever with DBC. It's always fun, informative and a different perspective on what software is and will be. </li>
				<li> Pairing is Caring- I have had the awesome opportunity to pair with older students and graduates of the DBC program. They all have random tidbits of knowledge from best coding practices, to better syntax to suggestions on how to break down a problem logically. You can learn a lot. The support is all there, you just need to grab it!</li>
				
				
				<h3> There are Bean Bags</h3>
				<p> And double monitor workstations and fun hammocks and a kitchen and gongs and a harry potter theme and a lovely view and carpeting and no shoes neccessary.</p>
									
				<h3> High expectations- for your personal growth</h3>
				<p>In my opinion, peer pairing is in itself and exercise in being a better person. But DBC encourages you to push yourself further (as they do with everything from yoga to techincal abilities). Each week there is an engineering empathy session. I refer to it somewhat facetiously as 'The Circle of Feelings'. But DBC's true aim is to make us self aware and conscientiousness people instead of cold code monkeys. It makes us closer as a cohort, which is why we hang out on Sunday and watch a movie about hackers.</p>

				<h3> Instafriends is a real concept here</h3>
				<p> You come into a group of people who are all here with a common goal- to learn how to be a great web developer. The diversity in backgrounds and interests is amazing. I am so excited for final projects because I know people will draw from their previous experience and expertise to make a great web app.</p>

				<h3> Random stats that are guesses/observations and not official in anyway</h3>
				<p><b>The median age of an average cohort-</b> It appears to be around 30 or so.</p>
				<p> <b>The number of women-</b> There were 7 when I got here. It will change when get our new cohort in on monday</p>
				<p> <b>Average Time spent at DBC on a weekday</b> 12 hours/day</p>
				<p> <b> Average Time spent at DBC on a weekend</b> 8 hours/day (for those who do come in)</p>
				
				<h3> The caliber of the teachers</h3>
				<p> I'll start with the Teaching Assistants. Many of them were former students and I think that speaks to the excellence of DBC's methods and madness. The TA's know an incredible amount and they know how to push you to ask better questions and then point you in the right direction. As with the instructors, their job is not to give you the answers you think want but the ones you need to be better. It's a fine line to walk and they do a great job. A lot of DBCers will tell you how annoying it is that no one just solves the coding challenge for you (or some part of it), but then proudly say how that helped them figure it out on their own.</p>
				<p> The teachers are much the same way. They lead the lectures and participate in the Engineering Empathy sessions. Sometimes they feel like my summer camp counselorls, reminding us not to be too uncouth and to maintain DBC reputation ("Please respect the other people in the building").</p>
