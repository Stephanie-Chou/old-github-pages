				<h2>DBC Culture</h2>
				<p> <em>Intense.</em> The DBC culture is intense. It places great expectations on its participants for integrity and persistance. At DBC, particpants get as much out of the program as they put in. I think that this is generally true of many endeavors, particularly those with a learning focus. I think that this is exciting.</p>
				
				<p><em>Collaborative.</em> DBC is also highly collaborative, despite the emphasis on self-driven learning. This is a culture reflective of a real working environment.</p>

				<p><em>Hacker.</em> That is an interesting word because it means different things to different people. To some (like my Mom) it sounds dangerous. To a lot of people I've met in software being a hacker is a badge of honor. Both of these definitions are reflective of a certain kind of culture. I feel that DBC is a hacker culture in that they encourage exploration and discovery.</p>

				<p><em>Expectations.</em> For every new journey or experience- I can't help but have some expectations. But expectations set the tone of how I approach things. And I don't want that. For me, the whole point of DBC is to start something new and fresh. So my expectations are only that whatever happens at DBC will be brand new and anything that happens from there will come with the territory.</p>
