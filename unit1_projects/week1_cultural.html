				<h2>DBC Culture</h2>
				<p> The DBC culture is intense. It places great expectations on its participants for integrity and persistance. At DBC, particpants get as much out of the program as they put in. I think that this is generally true of many endeavors, particularly those with a learning focus. I think that this is exciting.</p>
				<p> DBC is also highly collaborative, despite the emphasis on self-driven learning. This is a culture reflective of a real working environment.</p>
