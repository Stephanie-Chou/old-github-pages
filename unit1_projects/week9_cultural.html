					<h2> Asking Questions</h2>
					<p> A few weeks ago, I asked the following question on the DBC g+ community:</p>
					<p class="quote">"In My blogs I reuse the navigation code all the time. I want to do a php include so I don't have to update every page's navigation each time I change the navigation bar.

					I looked up how to do this but it isn't working. Any ideas? Is it because github cannot render it?ï»¿" </p>

					<p> Someone did respond, and it required a few follow up questions to get the response. I think that the first part of this question was clear because I described what I wanted to do. I think it would have helped to provide an example of what I wanted or what I had already tried in the code.  </p>

					<p> Sometimes, although someone doesnt provide the response you are looking for, they do provide enough information for you to rethink the question and find another way to look at the problem. The most difficult part of asking technical questions is when you are asking about topics you don't know a lot about. This often means your questions are missing keywords or concepts that would really help someone answer your question.</p>
