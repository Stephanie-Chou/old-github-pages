				<h2> The Stereotype Threat and Values</h2>

				<h4> Integrity </h4>
				<p> Integrity is the most important personal value I hold. This is why DBC's policies about being 'in' or 'out of integrity' is extremely strong and particularly effective wording for me. To me, integrity means to know yourself and what you believe and to act in accordance with those beliefs.

				Integrity is important to me above all the other values because I think it encompasses many values.
				People who act with integrity is trustworthy because they are true to him or herself and they will act with integrity. People who have integrity also have self respect and will power. It takes a lot of will power to have the self respect to act as you know you should even if others do not agree or don't understand.

				In general, I try to live up to these values. On a scale of 1 to 5, I think I am a 4. </p>

				<h4> Integrity and the Stereotype threat of being a Woman in Tech</h4>
				<p> Integrity is about staying true to your identity. So, if stereotype threat ever occurs, I just have to remember that I am not only defined as a 'Woman in Technology.' I am also an engineer, a student, an avid fan of Adventure Time and Yellowstone and much more.</p>
