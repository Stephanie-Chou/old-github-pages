				<h2> Why I Watch (and thoroughly enjoy) Adventure Time</h2>
				<p> My favorite episode is "I Remember You". I remember when it first aired and I watched it, I almost cried. The only reason I didn't actually cry was because I was watching it with people and public displays of crying make me uncomfortable.
				<p>This episode is the back story of two very different characters who have a history together. One is Marceline the Vampire Queen. She is a thousand years old, and sometimes loses sight of her moral code. But much of the time, she's just an angsty teenager. The other is The Ice King (once known as Simon). He is the often referred to as the biggest weirdo in the show and his madness and longevity come from a magical crown he wears. You often pity his character as he desperately searches for companionship by capturing princesses.</p>
				<p> Prior to this episode, that's really all you know about the two characters. And then suddenly the episode reveals that the Ice King was a kind and intelligent and saved Marceline in the aftermath of a terrible apocalyptic war when she was a little girl.</p>
				<p> In this episode, Marceline struggles with the fact that The Ice King is completely nuts and no longer remembers her. He just wants to sing with her, and he pulls out his journal. As they sing, you realize that the journal was written by the Ice King before he became lost in his own mind. The journal contain letters to Marceline apologizing for his decent into lunacy and the things he says.</p>
				<p> Now, that's some heavy stuff. I mean keep in mind that these episodes are only 11 minutes long including the theme song. This episode's theme has strong parallels to my experience watching my Great Grandmother struggle with dementia. When she couldn't remember me at times and hid her bananas behind the curtains instead of in the fridge- I began to avoid visiting her. But as Marceline says
					<div class="quote"> "You know I'm actually glad to see you. Maybe I'm the one who's...Nuts." </div>
				 It's powerful and rare for a children's show to delve into friendship the serious emotional turmoil of losing that relationship. And yet, the episode is filled with humor and enough childlike innocence to keep it a PG affair.</p>
				<p> And that is why I watch Adventure Time. </p>
