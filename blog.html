				<p><a href="https://squareup.com" target="_blank">squareup.com</a> is one of the most beautiful visual web designs I have seen. While I don't use any of their services, I really like how their landing page and market page. The landing page has lovely effects on scrolling. Videos play when you reach their section and it is very clean and informative. With just a few shades of color, the page acheives a lot visually. <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2>DBC Culture</h2>
				<p> <em>Intense.</em> The DBC culture is intense. It places great expectations on its participants for integrity and persistance. At DBC, particpants get as much out of the program as they put in. I think that this is generally true of many endeavors, particularly those with a learning focus. I think that this is exciting.<a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_cultural.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning</h2>
				<h3>Relative</h3>
				<p>A relative object is positioned within the normal flow of the page. This means that they will not overlap and will be positioned relative to the other objects around them. The below rectangle </p>

				<h2> Learning Style</h2>
				
				<p>My thinking style was identified as concrete sequential. According to this I like:</p>
				<li>following directions</li>
				<li>order</li>
				<li>getting facts</li>

				<p> I always find that I like mentorship and someone to ask questions and get clarification. I definitely think in terms of setting parameters or deliverables. I think part of this is a product of my personality an a lot of these tendencies are a product of my education as an engineer. In engineering, there is a lot of facts and directions. In projects, there are specifications which need to be followed. <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week2_cultural.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
				<h3>Easy, Easy and More Easy</h3>
				<p> When you search "Why is JavaScript so popular?" you come across a myriad of answers. But the most common word you see is "Easy." Javascript is easy to learn, easy to use, easy to edit and easy to extend (jquery!). <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week3_technical.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2>Arrays vs Hashes</h2>
				<h3>Arrays </h3>
				<p> Array elements are accessed by indices. This is why arrays are good for look ups (searching for information). Arrays allow you to store information of the same datatype into a single variable. In Ruby, an array doesn't have to contain elements of the same datatype <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week4_technical.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> Girls (Women) in Technology</h2>
				<p> When I Googled "problems facing the tech world" The majority of the issues that came up were actually not technical, but cultural. The response I saw most often was "Why we need more women in technology." This hit close to home because I am a woman in engineering and I have been part of that community for 4 years.</p>

				<h4>Here are a few pieces of the conversation I refer to in this blog. There were many more comments reflective of many sides of the issue.</h4>

				<h2> Pairing</h2>
				<p> Being Ahead</p>
				<p> Because I have had previous coding experience, I have had opportunity to teach and explain concepts to my pairs. This does some good because I definitely solidify my own understanding of concepts through explaining. I also find that pairs ask great questions I wouldn't have thought of and I learn a lot. <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week5_cultural.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> Vocabulary</h2>
				<li> <strong>Class: </strong> A way of organizing information and producing new objects. Ruby has some built in classes we're already familiar with such as Array.</li>
				<li> <strong> Object: </strong> Objects are instances of a class. </li>
				<li> <strong> Instance Variable: </strong> You can identify an instance variable because they are preceded with an '@' symbol. Instance variables are tied to the instance of a class. </li>

				<h2> OOP vs Functional</h2>
				<h4> OOP</h4>
				<p> Object Oriented Programming is organized around objects and data rather than 'actions' and logic.</p>
				<p> Advantages</p>
				<li> Reuse of Classes: Classes definitions are reusable by the progam it is originally written for as well as other object oriented programs. They can be reused!</li>
				<li> New data types: Programmers can make new data types. These data types can be used to define data more clearly </li>
				<li> inheritance: A class can have subclasses. This makes organization of data and information easier. It reduces development time</li>

				<h2> The Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<p> I actually touched on this subject in a previous blog post when I wrote about an issue that the tech industry faces which is a lack of women. As a female engineering student at a career fair, I often heard from people (even friends) that "Girls have no problem getting a job because they are girls. Everyone hires girls." <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week6_cultural.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> The Stereotype Threat and Values</h2>

				<h4> Integrity </h4>
				<p> Integrity is the most important personal value I hold. This is why DBC's policies about being 'in' or 'out of integrity' is extremely strong and particularly effective wording for me. To me, integrity means to know yourself and what you believe and to act in accordance with those beliefs.

				Integrity is important to me above all the other values because I think it encompasses many values. <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week7_cultural.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> SQL Injection and Prevention</h2>
				<h4> What is SQL Inject?</h4>
				<p>SQL injection is a way of attacking a database. The malicious DQL code is intended to fool the application and convince it that it wants to run the malicious code which will cause unintended results.
				For example, the original code may look like
				<pre lang='sql'>SELECT first_name FROM directory WHERE last_name='chang' '; </pre> <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week7_technical.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> Big O Notation</h2>
				<h4> What is Big O?</h4>
				<p> Big O notation describes the runtime of an algorithm. Big O notation is usually used to refer to the runtimes of common data structure algorithms. These algorithms include searches, traversals, insertions, deletions and indexing.<a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week8_technical.html">...read more</a></p>

			<h2> Conflict</h2>
			<ol>
				<li> <h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? </h4></li> 
				<p> I had to google emotional conflict to find out what experience I have had that might qualify. An emotional conflict is "the presence of different and opposing emotions relating to a situation that has recently taken place or is in the process of being unfolded".  Without getting too personal...? I don't like conflict and I tend to avoid conflict with people.<a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/week8_cultural.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> Get off the Struggle Bus</h2>
				<p> The struggle bus is frustration. It is unhappiness. It is the desire to keep going- but knowing that it is futile. The struggle bus is the moment you realize you are stuck like stale gum under a desk on a problem and you have been stuck for the past 73 minutes. <a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/phase1_week3_technical.html">...read more</a></p>

				<h2> A few things I didn't know about DBC, and now that I do, they seem worthy of sharing</h2>

				<h3> The Daily Schedule</h3>
				<li> 8:00 am- you are here before then. this is when the first announcements of the day are made. </li>
				<li> 9:00 -11:30 am- some mix of work time, lecture and/or activity (see below!)</li>
				<li> 11:30 am- Lunch! some people work, others work out. It's up to you.</li>
				<li> 1:00 pm - be back from lunch for afternoon announcements! At Chicago, we tell a joke. </li>
				<li> 1:00 - 5:00 pm- some mix of work time, lecture and/or activity. Working 'officially' ends at 5:00pm</li>

				<h2> Why I Watch (and thoroughly enjoy) Adventure Time</h2>
				<img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbyoibaAat1qjssm1o5_1280.png">
				<p> My favorite episode is "I Remember You". I remember when it first aired and I watched it, I almost cried. The only reason I didn't actually cry was because I was watching it with people and public displays of crying make me uncomfortable.
				<p>"I Remember You" tells back story of two very different characters.<a href="https://stephanie-chou.github.io/unit1_projects/lightning_talk.html">...read more</a>

				<h2> How to undo a Horrible Commit</h2>
				<p> I have heard these 4 heartbreaking words, this death blow of a phrase twice <div class="quote"> Who pushed to Master?</div> It is something we all fear doing at DBC because it means we over wrote the original source code for the day's challenge and now everyone sees your code instead of the instructor's. So either they now have the answer- or some horribly convoluted spaghetti pile. No one appreciates it. Nate (our instructor) showed me how to undo this travesty.</p>
