# Things are getting real

This week we finally got to start seeing the fruits of our labor. There are really things that we can create on a real screen. This is a basic CRUD app blog. It's like the Hello World of CRUD apps.

CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete (or destroy, if you feel destructive!) In a blog, you can create users. Users can create posts. Users can edit (update) their own posts. Users can delete their own posts. 


## This is the app as a basic walk through

## Blog with tagging feature!
As a user, you can add tags to your blog and search by tag. Admittedly not the best UX. But we are all about functionality right now.
