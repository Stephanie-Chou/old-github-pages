## The first almost full web app

###What is it
A ruby (not rails) backend that calls to a mail API to send down emails.
A javascript frontend. No frameworks. Some Underscore js for templating.
Each time the inbox is visited, the app queries the API again for the latest emails. If any new emails are available, they show up in the inbox.
Each time a user clicks in the side panel to search for tags, the app queries the database for any new tags a user may have created and then displays them. Users can filter their emails by tags.
Users can also read and write emails.

Note this project is just a single user. There are no actual communications going on. This is why there is an API spitting out emails.

###Demo
<div class = 'widescreen'>

</div>
###Working
In this project our group of 4 was mostly successfully able to split the backend from the frontend work.
