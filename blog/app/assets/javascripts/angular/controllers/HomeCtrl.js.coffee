  $scope.content = "I recently graduated from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Electrical Engineering. When I was younger, I wanted to be a paleontologist and could give my family a personalized tour of the dinosaur exhibits at the Chicago Field Museum. I eventually decided to pursue a degree in engineering because I believed the idea that engineers can 'do anything.' I spend my free time designing and redesigning this website and applying for jobs all while listening to Harry Potter audiobooks (read by the great Jim Dale) with unhealthy repetition. I am currently participating in the Chicago Dev Bootcamp Cohort."
