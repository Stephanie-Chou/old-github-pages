				<h2> Pairing</h2>
					<p> Being Ahead</p>
					<p> Because I have had previous coding experience, I have had opportunity to teach and explain concepts to my pairs. This does some good because I definitely solidify my own understanding of concepts through explaining. I also find that pairs ask great questions I wouldn't have thought of and I learn a lot.</p>
					<p> In the cases where I am ahead in material and teaching I often struggle to not give away too much of the answer while still being clear about the concepts. In coding, I strongly believe in working a strategy out for yourself, or searching for the answer yourself. If someone can effectively search for answers they will learn more quickly than if they are told how to do something. Also, in programming there is never one answer! I notice that this hesitancy to give away the answer is sometimes perceived as lack of assertiveness. I want to work on balancing this. I want to be able to show off what I know without taking away other people's opportunity to discover and learn.</p>
