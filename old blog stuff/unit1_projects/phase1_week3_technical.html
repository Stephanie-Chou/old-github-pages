					<h2> Get off the Struggle Bus</h2>
					<p> The struggle bus is frustration. It is unhappiness. It is the desire to keep going- but knowing that it is futile. The struggle bus is the moment you realize you are stuck like stale gum under a desk on a problem and you have been stuck for the past 73 minutes. </p>

					<p>	We've all been on the struggle bus at Dev Bootcamp. Today I sat down and realized "SQL is not fun for me." That was probably because I am not familiar with it. I am not even solid on the syntax... and there is a nested subquery nested something? What? But how do we untangle the mass of code that is the source of all the horror? Here is what I do: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Breathe: Step away from the computer. step away from the screen.</li>
						<li> p everywhere: puts, p, print. Anywhere you don't know something- look at it! figure out what it is. If you can't identify something- there's where you start. Object or not? Array or hash? Integer or string?</li>
						<li> Articulate: use your words. All good code starts with pseudocode. I like to integrate my pseudocode within the lines of actual code because it is like I am following a blueprint. Also, Pseudocode should read an awful lot like english- but it should be oddly precise. For example: Instead of "Put cookies in the oven" say "Put cookie objects in Oven's instance variable cookie array". If you can't explain your code in plain English (or your language of preference), you might want to step back and determine where the code's meaning gets opaque.</li>
						<li> Break it down: step by step, line by line, piece of code by piece of code.</li>
						<li> Whiteboards: whiteboards are my best friend. So are low-scent markers. I am not an exclusively visual person, but whiteboards give you a chance to think about the problem- not the syntax. A huge whiteboard full of writing feels like an accomplishment. </li>
						<li> Ask ALL THE QUESTIONS: Reread your blog about asking a good question, raise your hand and say "Help me!"</li>
					</ol>
