<p>Square</p>

<p> This website is trying to solve the problem "how to entice users to buy stuff" It is very simple because it is easy to peruse and scroll infinitely through the images. All the products are images. There is very minimal text other than the bare essentials that a user needs to know. The text is only available on hover which keeps the page free of text. This works very well because it makes all of the products stand alone and the good ones stand out just based on the image.</p>
